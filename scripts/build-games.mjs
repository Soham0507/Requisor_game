// Builds every brandable game and stages the output where the citrus-landing
// site expects to serve it, at `dist/public/game-previews/<slug>/`.
//
// Why this exists: in local dev the api-server serves each game straight out
// of its own `dist/public` (see artifacts/api-server/src/lib/game-previews.ts),
// but in production the site is a static bundle on a CDN. Rather than proxy
// large video assets through the API box, the games are built into the site's
// own output so the CDN serves them directly.
//
// Each game must be built with its public base path baked in, because the
// games reference their assets at runtime (e.g. `${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}
// newbb/home.mp4`) and are served from a sub-path, not the domain root.

// `envBase` games read BASE_PATH from the environment in their vite config;
